# DinnerBot

A simple PUBG bot I made for my friends in Discord.

This is what the bot currently does:
*checks a picture of a Chicken Dinner (PUBG win screen), then sends back a picture of an actual chicken dinner.\n
*retrieve player stats from masterpubg.com.

This small project is a result of me playing around with Python.

I'm an amateur in programming, so the code here may be inefficient and unstructured.
